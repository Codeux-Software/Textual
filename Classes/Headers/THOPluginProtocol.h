 messageInfo is a dictionary containing information related to the message
 posted. The following is a list of keys that promised to be in it. Some of
 these keys will not be in the dictionary depending on the actual line type
 but for the most part, we try to promise a few at most.
 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 |        Key                |        Type        |                    Description                                      |

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | lineType                  | Integer            | Integer representation of TVCLogLineType                            |
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | memberType                | Integer            | Integer representation of TVCLogLineMemberType                      |
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | receivedAtTime            | Date (NSDate)      | Date & time of the message. This is not the render time. This is    |
 |                           |                    | the actual date & time shown left of the message.                   |

 |                           |                    | to be a URL. Each entry in this array is another array containing   |
 |                           |                    | two indexes. First index (0) is the range in messageBody that the   |
 |                           |                    | URL was at. The second index (1) is the actual URL that was found.  |
 |                           |                    | The actual URL may differ from the value in the range as URL        |
 |                           |                    | schemes may have been appended.                                     |
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | mentionedUsers            | Set (NSSet)        | List of users from the channel that appear in the message.          |
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | messageBody               | String             | Raw, unrendered content of message sent to renderer.                 |

 isThemeReload informs the call whether the insertion occured during a style
 reload. Style reloads occur when a style is changed and the entire view has
 to have each message repopulated.
 
 isHistoryReload informs the call whether the insertion occured when the view
 was first initalized and it was part of the data from previous session being
 reloaded into the view. 
 
 It is NOT recommended to do any heavy work when isThemeReload and isHistoryReload
 is YES as these events have thousands of messages being processed.
 
 These events are posted on the dispatch queue associated with the internal plugin
 manager. They are never received on the main thread. IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT
 TO REMEMBER THIS BECAUSE WEBKIT REQUIRES MODIFICATIONS TO THE DOM TO OCCUR ON THE
 MAIN THREAD. So yeah, if you are are doing anything in inside this method that
 involves accessing this message, then do so on main thread. */
