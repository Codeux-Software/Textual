/* 
	TLOFileLogger is designed to be used exclusively by Textual (not plugins)
	for logging of IRC messages to plain text or property list files. Plain
	text logging is used for normal IRC logging while the property list write
	option is reserved for internal uses where the exact details of each message
	is required for later processing. 
 
	The directory in which this class writes to reads the user configured path
	unless a different one is specified by a class which implements TLOFileLogger.
