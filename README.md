# Textual [![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/Codeux-Software/Textual.svg)](https://github.com/Codeux-Software/Textual/blob/master) [![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-OS%20X-lightgrey.svg)](http://www.textualapp.com/mac-app-store)

Textual is a highly customizable app for interacting with Internet Relay Chat (IRC) chatrooms on macOS.

Textual can be customized with styles written in CSS, HTML, and JavaScript; [plugins](https://help.codeux.com/textual/Writing-Plugins.kb) written in Objective-C & Swift, and [scripts](https://help.codeux.com/textual/Writing-Scripts.kb) written in AppleScript (plus many other languages)

Precompiled versions of Textual can be purchased in the [Mac App Store](http://www.textualapp.com/mac-app-store) or [directly from Codeux Software](https://www.textualapp.com/fastspring-store/).

## Note Regarding Downloading Source Code

Textual is dependent on several other projects to build. This repository is automatically linked against these other projects using what are known as "submodules" — Clicking the "Download ZIP" button to build a copy of Textual will not download a copy of these projects. The source code must be cloned using [Github for Mac](https://mac.github.com/) or by using the following commands in Terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/Codeux-Software/Textual.git Textual
cd Textual
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Note Regarding Code Signing

**DO NOT change the Code Signing Identity setting through Xcode.** Textual uses a configuration file to specify the code signing identity. This allows it to be used accross all projects associated with Textual without having to modify each.

**DO** edit the file located at _[Configurations ➜ Build ➜ Code Signing Identity.xcconfig](https://github.com/Codeux-Software/Textual/blob/master/Configurations/Build/Code%20Signing%20Identity.xcconfig)_

**It is HIGHLY DISCOURAGED to turn off code signing.** Certain features rely on the fact that Textual is properly signed and is within a sandboxed environment.

**TEXTUAL DOES NOT REQUIRE A CERTIFICATE ISSUED BY APPLE TO BUILD** which means there is absolutely no reason to turn code signing off.

## Note Regarding Trial Mode

The code which is responsible for licensing paid copies of Textual is in the source code that you download from here.

If you do not have a license key, then set the ``TEXTUAL_BUILT_WITH_LICENSE_MANAGER`` flag to `0` in the `Standard Release` configuration file to disable the inclusion of this code at build time.

## Building Textual

The latest version of Textual requires two things to be built. One is a valid (does not need to be issued by Apple) code signing certificate. The second is an installation of Xcode 10.0 or newer on macOS High Sierra. **Building on anything earlier is not supported because of Swift 4.2 code.**

**DO NOT change the Code Signing Identity setting through Xcode.**
Once you have your code signing certificate, **DO NOT modify the Build Settings of Textual through Xcode**. Modify the file located at _[Configurations ➜ Build ➜ Code Signing Identity.xcconfig](https://github.com/Codeux-Software/Textual/blob/master/Configurations/Build/Code%20Signing%20Identity.xcconfig)_ instead.

Build Textual using the "Standard Release" build scheme.
