/**
 The name of a JavaSript object that a function named entrypoint()
 is called on for the purpose of inlining this payload.

 - Inheritance

 Textual offers a prototype named InlineMediaPrototype that your
 object can inherit from. This prototype already contains an
 entrypoint() function which you can override.

 - Function Arguments:

 The entrypoint function takes two arguments:

 1. The value of the -entrypointPayload property defined below.
 2. A callback function which itself takes one argument:
    The HTML that the entrypoint function wants to insert.

 - Requirements:

 • If the `html` property of this payload is empty:
     1. An entrypoint function is REQUIRED.
 • If the `html` property of this payload is NOT empty:
     1. An entrypoint function is OPTIONAL.
     2. If an entrypoint function is NOT set, then the value of
        the `html` property is inserted without assitance.
     3. If an entrypoin function is set, then the value of
        the contents of the payload are passed to it without
        inserting the value of the `html` property.
        The entrypoint function can then decide to insert the
        HTML when it wants by calling a callback function.

 - Example:

 ````
    MyObject.entrypoint = function(payload, callbackFunction)
    {
        // Do work here...

        callbackFunction("some HTML to display");
    }
 ````

 */
@property (copy, readonly, nullable) NSString *entrypoint;

/**
 A dictionary that is passed as the first argument to -entrypoint.

 - Dictionary Contents:

 This dictionary is guaranteed to always contain the following keys:

  1. "html" (string)
  2. "url" (string)
  3. "urlToInline" (string)
  4. "lineNumber" (string)
  5. "uniqueIdentifier" (string)

 The value of these keys mirror the payload's.

 ICLPayload will not allow you to override the value of these keys.

 - Types:

 Types are translated as such:

 ````
 Objective-C          JavaScript
 -----------          ----------
 NSArray         =>   array
 BOOL            =>   boolean
 NSNumber        =>   number
 NSDictionary    =>   object
 NSString        =>   string
 NSURL           =>   string
 ````

 Custom types are treated as "undefined"
