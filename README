- Introduction -

Textual is a highly modified version of the open source project known 
as LimeChat. The user interface is tailored towards users that have 
used darker themes of the Windows IRC client mIRC. The design of the 
client is mostly based around the open standard of WebKit which means 
it can be themed using CSS and JavaScript. Support for IRC commands 
based off AppleScript is also supported.

- Compiling -

Textual requires the code signing certificate located in the folder
"Extra/Code Signing/" to be loaded into the keychain of the machine
that will be doing the compiling. This certificate must also be set
to be trusted for code signing. This can be accomplished by right 
clicking the certificate in the "Keychain Access" application and
selecting "Get Info" — From the panel that pops up trust options can
be modified to meet the needs of the compiler. 

Also, Textual uses the BWToolkit plugin in order to add new user interface 
elements to its library. Therefore, before compiling make sure that the 
"BWToolkit.ibplugin" file has been loaded into the Interface Builder 
application. This file can be found in the folder "Frameworks/BWToolkit/"
