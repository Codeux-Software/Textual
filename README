#### Introduction ####

Textual is a highly modified version of the open source project known 
as LimeChat created by Satoshi Nakagawa. Much of the app uses the open 
standard of WebKit which makes customization easy through the use of 
CSS 3 and HTML 5. Plugins written in Objective-C and scripts made 
with AppleScript (and other languages) are also supported.


#### Building Textual ####

Please be aware while it is within your right to compile Textual and
redistribute it unlimited times; we will not actively provide support
for the actual building process as it has been known to introduce 
some bugs (even while supervised) that do not exist in the Mac App
Store version of Textual. General support for easy to answer questions
related to the actual use of the client is still available.

As a side note of the above paragraph: Some people think that denying 
support to people who build Textual on their own is about being money 
hungry. That simply is not the case. It is about providing the best 
available experience for everyone that uses Textual. We do not want 
some everyday user to see instructions on how to build Textual, try
it, then be dissatisfied if something fails.

This is espcially important when the repository is usually in a 
constant state of work which produces unstable code.

Anyways, to build it…

The latest version of Textual requires two things to be built. One is
a valid (does not need to be trusted) code signing certificate. The
second is an installation of Xcode 5 or later. 

If you are an Apple registered developer, then obtaining a signing 
certificate is not very hard. However, if you are not, a self-signed
certificate for "code signing" will do just as well. The steps to 
produce one of these is very simple so Google is the best destination
to check for the steps on making one of these.

It is HIGHLY DISCOURAGED to not try to turn off code signing. Doing
so will introduce some very common bugs which are a result of Textual
expecting to be within a code signed sandbox. One bug that will be 
introduced is the inability to write log files to disk. Another is
the possibility of Textual being denied write access for passwords. 

These bugs are not intentionally built into Textual to discourage 
building. They are a result of Apple's own APIs being dependant 
on the fact that Textual is code signed. 

As long as a self-signed certificate or an Apple Developer issued
certificate is available with its name containing "Developer ID
Application" then the only thing required to build Textual is
to open it and built it within Textual using the "Standard Release"
build scheme. There is no other special instructions. 

99% of build errors are related to code signing so making sure there
is some type of certificate available for signing will normally result
in a successful build every time.


#### App Store vs. GitHub ####

App Store Page: http://www.textualapp.com/

There are no differences between the code on GitHub and the binaries on
the Mac App Store. Be that as it may, we will not provide any support or
assistance to forks or self-built versions of Textual. We provide support 
for the current Mac App Store version. 

Sometimes the Mac App Store version may take a while to update, and that 
is not for lack of trying. Apple is notoriously known for how slow they 
approve apps in the Mac App Store. If you wish to build Textual for 
yourself, proceed at your own risk.
