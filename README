#### Introduction ####

Textual is a highly modified version of the open source project known 
as LimeChat. Much of the app uses the open standard of WebKit which 
makes customization easy through the use of CSS 3 and HTML 5. Plugins 
written in Objective-C and scripts made with AppleScript (and other 
languages) are also supported.
