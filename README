#### Introduction ####

Textual is a highly modified version of the open source project known 
as LimeChat. Much of the app uses the open standard of WebKit which 
makes customization easy through the use of CSS 3 and HTML 5. Plugins 
written in Objective-C and scripts made with AppleScript (and other 
languages) are also supported.

#### App Store vs. GitHub ####

App Store Page: http://www.textualapp.com/

There are no differences between the code on GitHub and the binaries on
the Mac App Store. Be that as it may, we will not provide any support or
assistance to forks or self-built versions of Textual. We provide support 
for the current Mac App Store version. 

Sometimes the Mac App Store version may take a while to update, and that 
is not for lack of trying. Apple is notoriously known for how slow they 
approve apps in the Mac App Store. If you wish to build Textual for 
yourself, proceed at your own risk.
