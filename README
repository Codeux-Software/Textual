#### Introduction ####

Textual is a highly modified version of the open source project known 
as LimeChat. The user interface is tailored towards users that wish to
move away from applications similar to Colloquy. Much of the app uses
the open standard of WebKit which makes customization easy through the
use of CSS 3 and HTML 5. Plugins written in Objective-C and scripts 
written in AppleScript (and other languages) are also supported.

#### Compiling Requirements ####

Developers compiling the Textual source code using version 4.0 of 
Xcode and later are asked to set Xcode to place the build product 
of each compile in the location specified by the targets. This 
setting can be changed by going to the "File" menu and then 
"Project Settings" â€” If this is not done, then the plugins will 
not be compiled in correct location for Textual to copy over. 

Additionally, Textual comes pre-packaged with four build schemes
for Xcode 4 users. It is recommended to only use these schemes
and none that Xcode itself automatically generates. These schemes
which are in the format "Textual (<build type>)" have already been 
configured for the best results. 

#### Friendly Request ####

It is asked that those with knowledge of compiling Textual do not 
abuse it to distribute binaries to large groups of individuals during 
the time period that it is exclusive to the Apple Mac App Store. 
We are simply asking to not abuse the BSD license too much so we do
not have to lock down the software with more obscure licenses.

not conform to the same GPL configuration as LimeChat.
