- Introduction -

Textual is a highly modified version of the open source project known 
as LimeChat. The user interface is tailored towards users that have 
used darker themes of the Windows IRC client mIRC. The design of the 
client is mostly based around the open standard of WebKit which means 
it can be themed using CSS and JavaScript. Support for IRC commands 
based off AppleScript is also supported.

- Compiling Requirements -

Textual uses the BWToolkit plugin in order to add new user interface 
elements to its library. Therefore, before compiling make sure that the 
"BWToolkit.ibplugin" file has been loaded into the Interface Builder 
application. This file can be found in the folder "Frameworks/BWToolkit/"

IMPORTANT: Xcode 4 users when compiling Textual be sure to set Xcode to 
build the product to the location defined by the targets. This setting 
can be changed by going to the File menu and then Project Settings. If 
this is not done, then the plugins will not be compiled in correct 
location for Textual to copy over.
