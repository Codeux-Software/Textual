- Introduction -

Textual is a highly modified version of the open source project known 
as LimeChat. The user interface is tailored towards users that have 
used darker themes of the Windows IRC client mIRC. The design of the 
client is mostly based around the open standard of WebKit which means 
it can be themed using CSS and JavaScript. Support for IRC commands 
based off AppleScript is also supported.

- Compiling -

Textual compiles as any normal application except for one small 
difference. Code Signing is used since Textual needs keychain access 
to store passwords so the certificate that is used to do the sign must 
be placed on the keychain of the machine compiling Textual. The certificate 
can be found in the folder Extra/Code Signing/ - Simply double click to 
open and install. It will prompt for a password installing. This is blank. 

After the certificate has been placed on the keychain it must be set to
be trusted for Code Signing. This can be done by right clicking it and
selecting "Get Info" - From the dialog that appears it can be set to be
trusted for signing.
