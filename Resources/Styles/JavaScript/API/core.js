	handleEvent allows a style to receive status information about several

	currently supported.

	serverConnected                 - Server associated with this view has connected.
	serverConnecting                - Server associated with this view is connecting.
	serverDisconnected              - Server associated with this view has disconnected.
	serverDisconnecting             - Server associated with this view is disconnecting.
	channelJoined                   - Channel associated with this view has been joined.
	channelParted                   — Channel associated with this view has been parted.
	channelMemberAdded              — Member added to the channel associated with this view.
	channelMemberRemoved            — Member removed from the channel associated with this view.

	THESE EVENTS ARE PUSHED WHEN THEY OCCUR. When a style is reloaded by Textual or
	the end user, these events are not sent again. It is recommended to use a feature
	of WebKit known as sessionStorage if these events are required to be known between
	reloads. When a reload occurs to a style, the entire HTML and JavaScript is replaced
	so the previous style will actually have no knowledge of the new one unless it is
	stored in a local database.

	defined by this object may require a callback function to receive return values. If a callback
	function is required, then the callback function should have one argument which is a variable
	defining the return value.

	For example:
		app.inlineMediaEnabledForView(
			function(returnValue) {
				console.log(returnValue);
			}
		)
*/

/* Checks whether inline media are enabled for this particular view. Inline media can be enabled and 
   on a per-view basis so querying preferences alone for the value will only give the global value. */
// app.inlineMediaEnabledForView(callbackFunction)

/* Returns true if the sidebar colors are inverted (dark mode). The preferencesDidChange() callback 
   can be used to monitor changes to the value of this function. */
// app.sidebarInversionIsEnabled(callbackFunction)

// app.serverIsConnected(callbackFunction)		- true if associated server is connected.
// app.channelIsJoined(callbackFunction)		— true if associated channel is joined.
// app.channelMemberCount(callbackFunction)		— Number of members on the channel associated with this view.

// app.serverChannelCount(callbackFunction)		— Number of channels part of the server associated with this view.
//												  This number does not count against the status of the channels.
//												  They can be joined or all parted. It is only a raw count.

// app.channelName(callbackFunction)		— Channel name of associated channel. Can be an actual channel name,
//											  a nickname for a private message, or blank for the console.

// app.networkName(callbackFunction)		— Returns the name of the client related to this view. If the actual network
//											  ame of the connected server is known (e.g. "freenode IRC network"), then
//											  that is returned. Otherwise, the user configured name is returned.

// app.serverAddress(callbackFunction)		— Actual server address (e.g. verne.freenode.net) of the associated
//											  server. This value is not available until raw numeric 005 is posted.

// app.localUserNickname(callbackFunction)		— Nickname of the local user.
// app.localUserHostmask(callbackFunction)		— Hostmask of the local user obtained during join.

/* *********************************************************************** */
/*						Print Debug Messages							   */
/* *********************************************************************** */

// app.logToConsole(<input>)		- Log a message to the OS X system-wide console.

/*	The app.printDebugInformation* calls documented below also call messageAddedToView() which means calling
	them from within messageAddedToView() will create an infinite loop. If needed inside messageAddedToView(),
	then check the line type of the new message and do not respond to line types with the value "debug" */

// app.printDebugInformationToConsole(message)		— Show a debug message to the user in the server console.
// app.printDebugInformation(message)				— Show a debug message to the user in the associated channel.

/*
	Textual provides the ability to store values within a key-value store which is shared
	amongst all views. The values stored within this key-value store are maintained within
	the preferences file of Textual within its sandbox and will exist even if the style is
	renamed, removed, or replaced.

	To opt-in to using a key-value store, add a string value to the styleSettings.plist file
	of a style with the name of it being "Key-value Store Name" — the value of this key should
	be whatever the name the key-value stored should be saved under. Preferably, it would be
	named whatever the style is, but a different one can be picked so that multiple variants
	of a style can share the same values.

	When setting a value of null, the specified key is removed from the store.
	Any other value is automatically converted by WebKit to match the following data types:

		JavaScript				ObjC
		----------				----------
		array			=>		NSArray
		boolean			=>		BOOL
		number			=>		NSNumber
		object			=>		NSDictionary
		string			=>		NSString

		ObjC					JavaScript
		----					----------
		NSArray			=>		array
		BOOL			=>		boolean
		NSNumber		=>		number
		NSDictionary	=>		object
		NSString		=>		string
		NSURL           =>      string

	When the value of a setting is retrieved, null will be returned if key is not found.
 */

// app.styleSettingsSetValue(key, value, callbackFunction)	— Set /value/ to /key/ in the key-value store.

	including the one that was responsible for changing the original value. */
