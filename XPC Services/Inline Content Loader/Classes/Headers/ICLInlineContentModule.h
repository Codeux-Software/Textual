 - Examples

 For example, if the module has the URL "example.com"
 and believes it is a regular image, then it can call
 this method with the type ICLMediaTypeImage to inform
 the media handler to inline the URL as an image.

 - Notes

 Calling this method to inline images or other media
 types is only required if the module is not already
 a subclass of one of the root classes responsible for
 handling these types of media.

 - Warnings

 This method will throw an exception if the module has
 already been finalized by calling this method or a sibling.

 - Arguments

 @param type
  The type of media that the content should be treated as.
  The types supported are:
  • ICLMediaTypeImage for images,
  • ICLMediaTypeVideo for videos,
  • ICLMediaTypeVideoGif for videos presented as a gif

 @param performCheck
  Whether to perform a web request to ensure that
  it is in fact the type described.
